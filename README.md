# Twitch JSON API

The purpose of this project is to provide a Twitch JSON API that is functionally similar to
https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/

## UX

As a user, I can see whether freeCodeCamp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
As a user, I can click the status output and be sent directly to the freeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv channel.
As a user, if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details on what they are streaming.

Array of the Twitch.tv users who regularly stream are ["ESL_SC2","OgamingSC2","cretetion","freecodecamp","storbeck","habathcx","RobotCaleb","noobs2ninjas"].
